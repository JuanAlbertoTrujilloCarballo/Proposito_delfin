    dialogueContentString: This is an old tapestry from the days where it was still
      home to the monks who worshiped Yuen with their beautiful singing voices. The
      contributions from the visitors grew bigger, but so did the greed of the singers.
      The richer they grew, the fewer singers remained. My granny, a superb mezzo,
      was a child when the last solo singer died. Ever since, the temple has been
      nothing but a tourist attraction.

    dialogueContentString: This is a statue depicting goddess Yuen, the deity who
      lives in this temple and the one who the poem I found is about. Being the wanna-be
      singer I am, I have a great devotion to Yuen. No doubt my granny was highly
      influential on that.
